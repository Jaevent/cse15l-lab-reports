I first installed visual studio code which was simply done by doing a quick google search. Then, I had to make sure that OpenSSH client was in my computer. I checked it in the options tab of my settings in optional features. After downloading visual studio code, my screen looked like this:
 

Then I remotely connected into the server by running the line ssh cse15lfa22ft@ieng6.ucsd.edu (my login for this account was not working yet so I used jtanuwidjaja@ieng6.ucsd.edu) in my terminal. The terminal then shows the following lines in my screen:
 




After I tried the command “ls -lat” the following lines appeared:
 
After I tried the command “cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt” the following lines appeared:
 
I then logged out of the remote server in my terminal by running the exit command. And made a file WhereAmI.java with its contents based on what is given in the lab assignment. Running scp WhereAmI.java jtanuwidjaja@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/, my terminal displays the following results:
 
After logging in to ssh with ls, the file is now in my home directory:
 
After running “java WhereAmI”:
 

After running the commands instructed in step 7 of the lab, I was able to login without using a password:
 
As for optimizing remote running, I think that having a text file of the command to log in to your ssh is a good idea for reducing the keystrokes that will be used to log on. For example I can copy all the required lines of code that I would use to login and simply copy and paste it into the next time I login into the terminal saving all the time typing it manually every single time.
