# Week 7 lab report
## Part 1
In `DocSearchServer.java`, change the name of the `start` parameter of `getfiles`, and its uses, to be called `base`.
Keystrokes in order (`week6-skill-demo` as the starting point:
* `vim D` `<Tab>` `<Enter>`
*  `/star` `<Enter>`
*  `ce`
*  `base` `<esc>`
*  `n.`
*  `n.`
*  `:wq` `<Enter>`

1. `vim D` `<Tab>` `<Enter>`:

`DocSearchServer.java` file in vim:

2. `/star` `<Enter>`

3. `ce`

`start` is deleted and enters insert mode:

4. `base` `<esc>`

`start` replaced by base and returns to normal mode:

5. `n.`

vim searches and replaces the next instance of `start` with `base`:

## Part 2

Time editing in VSCode and copy over files: 33 seconds
Time editing in vim: 24 seconds
Overall I would say that finding instances of `start` was easier to do in vim than in VSCode. Using vim was not too complicated other than the part where we are supposed to open the file.

* I prefer using VSCode because I am still not familiar with vim and the different keystrokes and in-built commands it has, in addition to how different keys execute different thing that I am usually familiar with. However, if I was more skilled in vim, I would probably use vim instead of VSCode. But overall in terms of efficiency, vim would be better.

* With my current understanding of my skills using vim and VSCode, if I were working on a larger project, I would prefer to use VSCode over vim. This is due to the fact that I am unfamiliar with vim and if I were to use vim, I can see myself doing a lot of mistakes. I feel more in control as of now when I use VSCode instead of vim, and I would probably make less mistakes with vim. And with a large project, I think that small mistakes can be detrimental and I would avoid editing with something I am not used to using. However, if the project is due soon and I am in a time crunch I would probably try my best to use vim.
